# Hose Race

TODO:

- format the text in the post card (limit and highlight the word in question)
- add nozzles to the hoses
- styles
- allow user to choose a word from league
- end game/scoring

BUGS:

- lines aren't quite aligned with progress
- hose height stretches its containing element which eats the postcard and header and footer. It seems like you can use `max-height` as long as it can reference a non-relative value (100% doesn't work). Will need to wrestle more with it (see chatgpt convo).
