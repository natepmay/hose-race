# Hose Race

Guess which words will appear the most on English-language Bluesky in realtime.

This was a small project for me to get comfortable with React and play with the Bluesky firehose.

## Stack

- React (only client-side)
- Typescript
- Vite
- Deno (for `data` folder only)

## Data

In order to make the game fun I needed to match up sets of words ("leagues") that appear at roughly the same rate of occurence on Bluesky. For this I periodically took "sips" from the firehose and analyzed the top words used. I then aggregated this data, manually eliminated some words, and grouped words by their median occurrences across all of the sips. The result is in `data/leagues.json`. I've also copied this file into the `public` folder so the app can access it in the frontend.

## Getting Started

To run the web app locally:

First clone this repo, then:

```bash
cd hose-race
npm install
npm run dev
```

To explore the `data` folder, you'll need to [install the Deno runtime](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/).

Then:

```bash
cd hose-race/data
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net name_of_file.ts
```
